    # such that the methods and function call feel like to be called locally.

    # convert is a method on stub that is defined as the RPC in pur scribble.proto file that converts
    # text into an image. The body of the function is written in Go and lives in a server
    #
    # The response object holds the Image data in the form of raw bytes as defined in 
    # the protocol buffer file scribble.proto.
    # The rest of the code is self explainatory

    # TODO: implement the cli to make this program work as a CLI tool just like it go counterpart

    # try experimenting with the parameters to the convert function.


    # As the open function expects strings as its argument when opened with 'w' mode.
    # We need to open our file for writing in write as bytes mode for our file.
    # As the Image is defined as a response from the RPC as a stream of bytes in the scribble.proto definition.
